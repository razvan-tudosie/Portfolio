        <h2 class="md:text-5xl text-4xl py-4">It all began with an ideea</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mt-4">When the Co-Founder approached me, The Travel Quest was just a concept represented by sketches, a small brand book with the logo, typography, and brand colors. I identified key users, mapped out user flows, and developed wireframes. With a clear vision and structure, the design process began, transforming the initial idea into a tangible, engaging app.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mt-4">One of the key pain points in the design process was ensuring that The Travel Quest app is easy to use for a diverse audience with varying levels of tech-savviness. To address this, the focus was on creating a design that is simple, intuitive, and familiar to everyone. Through research and careful consideration of user needs, I developed an interface that seamlessly guides users through their adventure, making the treasure hunt accessible and enjoyable for all participants.</p>

        <p class="text-lg mt-4">Thinking about the project and the diverse, unique people involved, I decided to design a unique avatar system based on topography maps of different locations around the world.</p>

        <h2 class="md:text-5xl text-4xl py-4">The Process</h2>
        <p class="text-lg mt-4">For each topographical map, I rotated the map by 90 degrees and created four iterations. Using the brand color palette, I developed two distinct color variations for each map, resulting in 12 color pairs.</p>
